## Objective

To demonstrate image registration and stitching using features detection and matching built-in OpenCV with Python API. 

## Code

## What is Image Stitching?

So what is image stitching ? In simple terms, for an input group of images, the output is a composite image such that it is a culmination of scenes. At the same time, the logical flow between the images must be preserved.

For example, consider the set of images below. From a group of an input montage, we are essentially creating a singular stitched image. One that it covers the full scene in details.
