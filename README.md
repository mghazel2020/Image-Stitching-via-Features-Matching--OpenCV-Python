## 3 What is Image Stitching?

So what is image stitching ? In simple terms, for an input group of images, the output is a composite image such that it is a culmination of scenes. At the same time, the logical flow between the images must be preserved.

For example, consider the set of images below. From a group of an input montage, we are essentially creating a singular stitched image. One that it covers the full scene in details.


<table>
  <tr>
    <td> Image # 1</td>
    <td> Image # 2</td>
    <td> Image # 3 </td>
   </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td> <img src="images/mountain-scene-image-001.jpg" width="300"  ></td>
    <td> <img src="images/mountain-scene-image-002.jpg" width="300"  ></td>
    <td> <img src="images/mountain-scene-image-003.jpg" width="300"  > </td>
   </tr> 
</table>
